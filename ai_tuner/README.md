# Requirements
You need python, but for now you are on your own on how to set that up.  
What I do (on linux) is:  
  
pipenv install  
pipenv run pip install pyyaml pandas  
  
# How to run
pipenv run python3 main.py
  
# What this does
Choose your GTR2 installation path, choose the folder where the Teams are, then you can edit the drivers all at once.  
  
# Wishlist
This really needs a better info about what each variable does, and an easier way to change several drivers simultaneously (e.g.: make all drivers better in the wet).   
It'd be nice to even create some predefined "skill levels" to easy adapt the drivers to them.  
  
# Issues
A LOT. Need to automate installation of requirements, need to test on windows...
